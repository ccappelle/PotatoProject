# pyrosim
A Python Robot Simulator.

Step 1: Run build.sh:
```bash
$ sh build.sh
```

Takes 3-5 minutes. The output should look like this:
```
Unpacking ode-0.12.tar.bz2...done
Building ode-0.12...done
Building simulator...done
```

Step 2: Test the package by running
```bash
$ python2.7 empty.py
```
This should bring up an OpenGL window into a desolate virtual world for about 3 seconds. Do not avert your eyes!
